# HiLowGame-Practice
Code with HiLowTools class structure but without the code for coding practice.  Run HiLow.exe to see how the game works and then code up your own version.  HiLow.SetMaxNumberOfGuesses() lets you enter how many guesses are allowed but makes sure you are within a range ( try entering -1)
